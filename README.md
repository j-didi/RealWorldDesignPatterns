# Real World Design Patterns

Since there are a lot of misconceptions and some controversy about real-world use cases and the benefits of **Design Patterns**, I've decided to create this repository where I'll develop and share some implementations of them. Each pattern will have a **README** file with a **components relationship diagram** and explanations about it. The code will be in **C#**, but the concept is **language agnostic**.
