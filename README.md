# Real World Design Patterns

Since there is a lot of misconceptions and some controversy about real world use cases and benefits of Design Patterns, I've decide to create this repository where I'll share some implementations of legendary GoF Design Patterns. Any implementation will have a README with a diagram of components relationship and explanations about de patterns itself. The implementations will be in .NET and C# but the concept its language agnostic.
