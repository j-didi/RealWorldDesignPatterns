# Real World Design Patterns

Since there is a lot of misconceptions and some controversy about real world use cases and benefits of Design Patterns, I've decide to create a repository where I'll develop and share some implementations of the GoF Design Patterns. All implementations will have a README with a components relationship diagram and explanations about the pattern itself. The implementations will be in C# but the concept its language agnostic.
